## Problem Statement:

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Intuition:

To add two numbers represented by linked lists, we start from the rightmost digits (least significant) and move towards the left. We perform addition digit by digit, considering any carryover from the previous addition. Each time we add digits, we create a new node to store the result. By continuing this process until both numbers and any carryover are exhausted, we generate a new linked list representing the sum.

### Explanation:

1. **Setting Up**: We start with a placeholder node `dummyHead` to hold the result and a pointer `tail` to keep track of the last node in the result list. We also initialize a variable `carry` to hold any carryover during addition.

2. **Addition Loop**: We loop through both input lists (`l1` and `l2`) and the carry value until all digits are added.
   - **Inside the Loop**: 
     - We consider the current digits from both lists (`l1` and `l2`) along with any carryover from the previous addition.
     - We add these digits and the carryover to get the sum.
     - From this sum, we extract the digit for the current position and update the carry value for the next iteration.
     - We create a new node with the calculated digit and attach it to the result list.
     - We move the `tail` pointer to the newly added node.
     - We move to the next digits in both input lists, if available.

3. **Finalizing the Result**: After the loop, we have the result linked list. We skip the `dummyHead` node to obtain the actual result.

4. **Cleanup**: We delete the `dummyHead` node.

5. **Return**: Finally, we return the resulting linked list.

By following this process, we effectively add the two numbers represented by the input linked lists and return the sum as a new linked list.
